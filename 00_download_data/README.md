## Download and process TCGA data

This directory stores scripts to download and process various data modalities
from TCGA.

### Repo organization

Top-level `.ipynb` scripts should be run linearly as notebooks to download
and preprocess data. Scripts in `./nbconverted` are for code review purposes
and are not intended to be run on their own.

### Data information

TODO: update this with details once preprocessing is implemented
